### Grammar Definitions

```
# Grammatical Elements:
#
# * Strings with double quotes (") denote keywords.
# * Upper case names (NAME) denote tokens in the Grammar/Tokens file.
# * First character upper case names (Name) denote rule names.
#
# Grammar Syntax:
#
# Rule Name = expression
#   The rule is defined by the expression. 
# expression 1, expression 2
#   Match expression 1, then match expression 2.
# expression 1 | expression 2
#   Match expression 1 or expression 2.
# ( expression )
#   Match expression.
# [ expression ]
#   Optionally match expression.
# { expression }
#   Match zero or more occurrences of expression.
